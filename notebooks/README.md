# Notebooks

This directory contains a set of exploratory jupyter notebooks which were used in the development of the project.

## Extra dependencies

These notebooks use a few libraries which are not necessary for the rest of the project (eg for data visualisation). If you want to run these notebooks, you can install the extra dependency group with the following command:

```bash
poetry install --with notebook
```
